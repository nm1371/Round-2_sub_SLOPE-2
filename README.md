Round-2_sub_SLOPE-2 code is associated to find  a feasible solution of the underdetermind linear system equations with bounded variables, that is,
find v
s.t. Sv=0,
     l_1<v<u_1.
Execution process:'Please copy the code in matlam.'    
How to use:    
Please set your file name, your sheet and your data range for matrix S on lines 7-9.
Please set  your data range for lower bound vector l_1 on the line 16.
Please set  your data range for lower bound vector u_1 on the line 22.
